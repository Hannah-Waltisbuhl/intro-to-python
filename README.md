Initially, we will create a new codespace from an existing repository. In following weeks, we will pull each week's content from the same repository using the ```git pull``` command. 

Search for the repository "intro-to-python-dev" in the search box, ensure that the author of the repository you select is jackwfrench. The remaining default options should not be changed, so click the green "Create codespace" button.

You should now be able to see a cloned repository in which you can see the weekly content, run notebooks cells and test your code.

NOTE: this is a linux environment. The integrated terminal is a linux shell, so windows commands will not work here.

```sh
python -V
```
